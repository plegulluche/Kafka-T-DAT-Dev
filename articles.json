           "The new round comes just over three months after Cube raised $9 million in seed funding. Cube CEO Bartosz Lipinski, a former Solana engineer, said that the company wasn't actively seeking funding but responded to \"considerable inbound interest\" from investors. \"We closed the entire round in under a month,\" Lipinski told The Block, referring to the period after Cube launched its early access mode last November.",

Lipinski said this approach enables users to view their assets on-chain without relying on proof-of-reserve audits and also eliminates the need for wrapped assets.",
